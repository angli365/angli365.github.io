AMIQ's Design and Verification Tools (DVT) IDE is a powerful development environment for hardware engineers working with HDL languages like Verilog, SystemVerilog, and VHDL. Let's explore what DVT IDE offers and how to get started using it.

## What is DVT IDE?

DVT IDE is a specialized development environment that boosts productivity for hardware design and verification. It provides intelligent features that go far beyond a basic text editor, helping engineers write better code faster and navigate complex hardware projects with ease.

Here's a demonstration of DVT IDE's seamless workflow when working with SystemVerilog/Verilog code. Notice the intelligent code navigation, real-time error detection, and more in action:

## Key Features

### Smart Code Editing

DVT IDE makes coding more efficient with:

- Real-time compilation and error detection
- Intelligent code completion and suggestions
- Quick navigation through code via hyperlinks
- Semantic search capabilities

### Verification Support 

The IDE provides comprehensive support for hardware verification:

- Full integration with UVM, OVM, and VMM methodologies
- Automated compliance checking against methodology guidelines
- Tools to help migrate between different verification frameworks
- Built-in templates and wizards for common verification tasks

### Visual Tools

Understanding complex designs becomes easier with:

- Interactive UML diagrams showing class relationships
- Design hierarchy visualization tools
- Intuitive structural browsers for navigating class hierarchies
- Signal and connectivity viewers

## Getting Started with DVT IDE

You can use DVT IDE either as a VS Code extension or as a standalone Eclipse-based application:

### VS Code Setup

1. Install the Extension
   - Search for "AMIQ DVT" in the VS Code marketplace
   - Click Install to add the extension

2. Configure Licensing
   - Open VS Code settings (CTRL/CMD + ,)
   - Search for "DVT license"
   - Enter either:
     - Path to your local license file
     - Address of your license server
